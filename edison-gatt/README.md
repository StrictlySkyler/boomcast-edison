Welcome to Edison-BLE, an open-source BLE GATT service for Intel Edison developers using Bleno. 


This project is under active development.Currently it is possible to put the BLE GAT online and view the available exposed characteristics. However, I am working with the Bleno creator on advancing this GAT to a more complete state.
